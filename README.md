# NAIF-Illumination-Example
This project was based on using NAIF's SPICE package on Matlab.
The coding that will be provided makes use of the illumination functions of cspice, in particular the cspice_ilumin() function.

The data/kernels needed to run the program will be provided in order to calculate the illumination angles of the sun onto a target body observed by an observing body.

The code provided uses KAGUYA(SELENE), the spacecraft used for a lunar mission beginning late 2007, as the observer and the moon as the target body.
